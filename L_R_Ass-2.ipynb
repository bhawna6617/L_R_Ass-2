    "# The purpose of Grid Search Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV) in machine learning is to systematically search for the optimal hyperparameters for a given model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not directly learned from the data but rather set prior to the learning process. They can significantly impact the performance of a model, and selecting the right hyperparameters is crucial for building a model that generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# GridSearchCV works by exhaustively searching through a specified grid of hyperparameters and evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the Model: First, you specify the machine learning model you want to use, along with a grid of hyperparameters that you want to tune. For example, if you're using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), you might want to tune parameters like the kernel type, C (regularization parameter), and gamma.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the Search Space: Create a dictionary where the keys are the hyperparameters you want to tune, and the values are lists of values to try for each hyperparameter. This defines the grid of hyperparameters to search through.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cross-Validation: Split the training data into multiple folds (typically k-folds), where each fold serves as a validation set while the remaining folds are used for training. GridSearchCV performs cross-validation for each combination of hyperparameters in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Training and Evaluation: For each combination of hyperparameters, GridSearchCV trains the model on the training data (excluding the validation fold) and evaluates its performance on the validation fold. This process is repeated for each fold in the cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select Best Hyperparameters: After evaluating all combinations of hyperparameters, GridSearchCV selects the combination that produces the best performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, etc.) on the validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrain Model: Optionally, you can retrain the model on the entire training dataset using the best hyperparameters selected by GridSearchCV to obtain the final model.\n",

Data leakage can lead to over-optimistic model performance estimates and ultimately poor generalization to unseen data. It is a significant problem in machine learning because it can result in models that appear to perform well on the training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",

For instance, if missing values are imputed using information from the entire dataset, including the test set, this can leak information and bias the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature Engineering: Creating features based on information that would not be available at prediction time can also introduce leakage. For example, if predicting credit card fraud, using features derived from transaction timestamps or account balances up to the current time can leak information about future transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Target Leakage: This occurs when features that are highly correlated with the target variable but not causally related are included in the model. For example, if predicting loan default, including features like \"number of loan applications in the last month\" could lead to target leakage because this information is influenced by the target variable (default) itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data leakage is problematic because it can lead to overfitting, where the model learns patterns that are specific to the training dataset but do not generalize to new data. This can result in poor performance and unreliable predictions when the model is deployed in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Suppose you're building a model to predict stock prices. You include features such as moving averages of stock prices over the past 10 days. However, you accidentally use future information when calculating these moving averages (e.g., including tomorrow's stock prices in today's calculation). This introduces data leakage because the model is using information about the future to predict the past, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates during training. When deployed in the real world, the model fails to perform well because it cannot access future information at prediction time."
